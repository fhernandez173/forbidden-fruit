# str method to convert variable age from int
# single target
print("My age is " + str(age) + " years")

# method format replaces matching index items
print("My age is {0} years.".format(age))
# better example
print("There are {0} days in {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}, {5}, {6}, and {7}.".format(31, "January", "March", "May", "July", "August", "October", "December"))

# using triple quote to format nicely
print("January", "March", "May", "July", "August", "October", "December"))
